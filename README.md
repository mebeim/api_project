# api_project

This repo contains the final project of my Algorithms and principles of computer science (italian Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica, aka A.P.I.) course.

## Source

The entire project has been split into different header and source files for clarity, but a complete source file, which is the one I had to submit for evaluation, containing all that's needed, is included. The license regulating use and redistribution of the source code is provided in `LICENSE.md`.

## Documentation

The project assignment and description can be found in the `doc` folder, along with a simple description of the data structure used. The project assignment PDF which describes the program in detail is in italian.

## Building

Work in progress...
